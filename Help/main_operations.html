%% Operate with spectra
%% Perform arithmetic operations
% Once the data are loaded into appropriate _specdata_ or _specdata2D_ objects, 
% these objects can be used to perform calculations, such as arithmetic operations. 
% A fundamental concept when performing any type of operations with Spectr-O-Matic 
% is to create a *new* object entity by performing operations on one or more *old* 
% objects:

c = a + b;
f = d/2;
x = sum([u, v, w]);
%% 
% The new objects _c_, _f_ and _x_ are created by performing operations 
% on _a, b, d, u, v_, and _w_. The original objects are not modified. If you want 
% to *modify* an existing object entity instead, simply place its name on the 
% left side of the '=' sign:

a = a + b;
%% 
% The expression will calculate the sum of _a_ and _b_ and the result will 
% be stored in _a_, effectively replacing the contents of _a._
% 
% The four basic arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication 
% and division can be performed on Spectr-O-Matic objects with the respective 
% binary operators |+|, |-|, |/|, and |*|. In the expression

c = a + b;
%% 
% _c_ is the result, + is the operator sign, _a_ is the left operand and 
% _b_ is the right operand. When either of the operands _a_ or _b_ is a Spectr-O-Matic 
% object, the result _c_ is also a Spectr-O-Matic object. The operation is always 
% performed on the _Y_values of the operands. The rest of the properties are transferred 
% without change from the left operand _a _to the result _c_. 
% 
% Either operand of binary arithmetic operations can be a real number, rather 
% than a _Spectr-O-Matic_ object. For example the expression |b = 5; c = a - b 
% |will subtract 5 from each _Y_ value in _a_ and the expression |a = 10*a| will 
% multiply _a_ by 10. 
% 
% As mentioned in the previous section, the operands can be arrays of numbers 
% or spectra, in which case the operations will be performed on every number/spectrum 
% in the array.
%% Object arrays
% Multiple _specdata_ (and _specdata2D_) objects can be combined in object arrays 
% and then accessed under the same MATLAB identifier. One way of creating an array 
% is by reading several data files at once as shown in *<#_Creating_SpecData_objects 
% Creating specdata objects>*. Existing objects can be combined into arrays using 
% MATLAB's array operator [ ]. The command

x = [u v w];
%% 
% creates an array _x _with three elements, which will be copies of _u_, 
% _v_ and _w_. In this expression any or all of the operands _u, v _and _w_ can 
% be object arrays themselves. In such case they will be _concatenated_ (appended 
% one after another).
% 
% Objects are indexed in object arrays in the same way as numbers in number 
% arrays. To reference a particular object, specify its index in parentheses ( 
% ). The next command statement has the same result as the one above, although 
% it is less efficient to write and execute:

x(1) = u; x(2) = v; x(3) = w;
%% 
% Range of objects can be specified with the range operator '|:|' in expressions 
% such as 

B = A(1:5); C = A(6:end)
%% 
% Most _Spectr-O-Matic_ operations can be performed on single objects as 
% well as object arrays. If _x _is an array, the statement |y = 2*x;|will multiply 
% all spectra in _x_ by 2 and the result _y_ will also be an object array with 
% the same number of spectra as _x_. Not that in this binary operation, the right 
% operand is an object array and the left operand is a single number. _Spectr-O-Matic_ 
% will recycle that number to perform operations on all objects in the array. 
% However, both operands can be arrays, as in the next example:

A = specdata.load({'dat1.txt', 'dat2.txt', 'dat3.txt'});
N = [1, 0.8, 1.5];
An = A / N;
%% 
% Here _A_ is an array created by loading three files. _N_ is an array of 
% three numbers, representing normalization factors. The last statement divides 
% each spectrum in _A_by the corresponding number in _N_. The normalized spectra 
% are stored in _An_.
% 
% When performing binary operations with two array operands, the number of 
% elements in one array should be the same as in the other array. If one array 
% has fewer elements then its elements will be reused. For example, if _b_ is 
% an array of two elements, then the result of the expression |a*b| will be an 
% array [_a_1_b_1, _a_2_b_2, _a_3_b_1, _a_4_b_2, …].
% 
% Both operands can be arrays of spectra, or one operand can be an array 
% and the other a single spectrum:

x = [u v w] – x0;
%% 
% The spectrum _x_0 will be subtracted from each of the spectra in the left 
% operand. Note that here an array was created directly in the expression where 
% it was used.
%% Other operations on spectra
% Most of the functionality of _Spectr-O-Matic_ is implemented as _methods_ 
% of the classes _specdata_ and _specdata2D_. There are methods that calculate 
% properties, such as the number of datapoints in a spectrum (_*dim_*), methods 
% to normalize (_*norm_*), integrate (_*int_*), differentiate (_*diff_*), smoothen 
% (_*smooth_*) spectra and so on. The same concept applies as with arithmetic 
% operations, i.e. a new object is created by performing operations using a given 
% method. Methods are called either by using dot notation:

S = A.sum;
%% 
% or by using function notation:

S = sum(A);
%% 
% The two expressions are equivalent and will calculate the sum of _A_, 
% assuming that _A_ is an array of spectra.
% 
% Some methods return real numbers as a result instead of objects. For example 
% the method dim returns the number of data points in a one-way spectrum, or the 
% number of _X_and _T_ values in a 2D dataset. The methods _*max_* and _*min_* 
% return the global maximum and global minimum of each operand spectrum. The expression:

An = A / A.max;
%% 
% will divide the spectrum _A_by its maximum. If _A_ is an array, all spectra 
% will be divided by their corresponding maxima. The statement is equivalent to:

An = A.norm;
%% 
% The method _*Xind_* searches for a given _X_ value and returns its index 
% in the _X_ array. A similar method _*Yx_*searches for an _X_ value and returns 
% the corresponding _Y_ value. The statement

An = A / A.Yx(650);
%% 
% will normalize the spectrum (or spectra) _A_ at |X = 650|. 
% 
% For _specdata2D_objects the method will return an array of all _Y_ values 
% that correspond to the given _X._ An equivalent method Yt returns the _Y_ values 
% for a given _T_.
% 
% In addition to methods operating on the _Y_ data only, there are a few 
% methods operating on the _X_ (and _T_) axes of Spectr-O-Matic objects. The methods 
% _*setxlim_* and _*settlim_*trim the spectra to a range of _X_ (_T_) values:

Ablu = A.setxlim([420 480]);
Ared = A.setxlim([620 680]);
%% 
% The result is a spectrum, in which any data lying outside the specified 
% _X_ range are discarded. Other methods operating on _X_ are _*bin_*(box-car 
% averaging), _*setx_* (replaces the _X_ axis and interpolates the _Y_ data to 
% match the new axis), and _*merge_*(joins spectra together).
