%% Getting Started with _Spectr-O-Matic_
% The _Spectr-O-Matic_ toolbox is designed to organize, visualize and perform 
% calculations with spectroscopic data.
%% What is a spectrum
% Generally speaking, a spectrum is an array of related X-Y number pairs:
% 
% |Y = f(X)|
% 
% Thus, a spectrum consists of two columns of real numbers: |X| and |Y|. 
% 
% |X| typically represents frequency, wavelength, or time, and |Y| – a measured 
% quantity, such as absorbance.
% 
% Spectr-O-Matic stores spectra as objects of class |specdata|. A |specdata| 
% object contains one column vector of _X_ values, one column vector of _Y_ values, 
% and additional properties (storing related metadata:
% 
% * |ID| - a string identifying the spectrum
% * |ExpID| - a string identifying the experiment
% * |XType, YType| - type of _X _and_ Y_ data (e.g. 'Wavelength', 'Absorbance')
% * |XUnit, YUnit| - measurement units (e.g. 'nm',  'mOD')
% * |DateTime| - date and time of the measurement (date string).
% * |Comment| - user remarks
% * |History| - operations log string
% 
% A separate class, |specdata2D|, is designed for two-way spectroscopy data, 
% such that |Y| is measured as a function of two independent variables, |X| and 
% |T| :
% 
% |Y = f(X,T)|
% 
% where |T| could represent time (in time-resolved spectroscopy) or any other 
% quantity. The main difference between |specdata| and |specdata2D| is that the 
% _Y_ values in |specdata| are a single column of numbers (vector), whereas in 
% |specdata2D| the _Y_ values are a two-dimensional matrix with a number of rows 
% equal to the number of _X_ values and a number of columns equal to the number 
% of _T_ values.
%% Access data in a spectrum
% In MATLAB, objects stored in memory can be addressed and manipulated by their 
% unique identifier (name). Let a spectrum be stored in memory by the name |SP|. 
% Its properties can be accessed using dot-notation: |SP.X| and |SP.Y| will return 
% the array of _X_ and _Y_ values, respectively, |SP.DateTime| will return the 
% date and time of the measurement, etc.
% 
% The simplicity and elegance of _Spectr-O-Matic_ lies in the fact that spectra 
% stored as objects can be used in mathematical expressions like |c = 2*a| or 
% |c = a + b| , just as if they were simple numbers. In the latter expression, 
% if |a| and |b| are spectra of class |specdata|, the result |c| will be the summed 
% spectrum. 
%% General workflow
% A sequence of _Spectr-O-Matic_ operations can be written as a MATLAB script 
% and executed or modified later as many times as needed. Typically the data analysis 
% involves these steps:
% 
% # Load data into _Spectr-O-Matic_ objects
% # Perform operations – mathematical operations, preprocessing
% # Search and index – categorize data, make selections, perform operations 
% on groups of data
% # Plot data
% # Save or export processed data
